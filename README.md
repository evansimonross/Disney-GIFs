# Disney-GIFs
A project to practice API calls with GIPHY. 

## How To Use
[Click here to try it out](https://evansimonross.github.io/Disney-GIFs/).

When the page loads, a group of Disney movie titles is randomly generated at the top of the screen. Clicking a movie title will show 10 GIFs from GIPHY tagged with that title. Clicking the same title again will display 10 new GIFs. On the right of the page some information about the movie from OMBD is shown. 

The user can toggle different lists of movie titles by choosing one of the supplied topic sets. They can also submit their own title which will immediately be added onto the end of the list. 

The Clear GIFs button removes all GIFs and movie information from the page. 

Under each GIF, the GIF's rating is displayed, and a download button. Cross-origin download links are ignored, so image will just open in a new tab, where the user should download it themselves. There is also a favorite button which users can click to add the movie to their favorite list. Anytime one of their favorite images loads on the page, the favorite icon will be pink. Click it again to remove it from the favorites list. All favorite images can be loaded with the Favorite GIFs button. 

## Project History
This project was a homework assignment for the Columbia Full Stack Web Development Coding Bootcamp, testing our ability to use AJAX and API calls in Javascript. The project prompt was much more specific this time, and I have very closely followed their model: a dynamically created group of buttons which, when clicked, display 10 GIFs from GIPHY and the option for a user to submit their own button. I also included many of the bonus goals for the project provided including the favorites option and the use of an additional API. The theme was up to the students, and I chose Disney animated movies because I thought there would likely be lots of entertaining GIFs from them.
